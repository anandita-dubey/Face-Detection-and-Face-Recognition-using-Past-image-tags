# Face-Detection-and-Face-Recognition-using-Past-image-tags

Automation helps in building systems that are easy to use and profitable. With the use of Automation, we can achieve Improved Customer Experience, Continuous Improvement, and Improved Performance. The application aims to use Automatic Face Detection and Recognition system on the image uploaded by the user on social media and provide tags to the user for the faces detected in the image. The Tags are predicted by a Progressive Machine Learning Model, which learns every time it discovers a new image with new facial features and predicts tags for faces in the new image which have similar features. Traditional way of tagging faces in an image is Manual. Automating this with the help of Machine Learning will Improve Customer Experience, with the help of Progressive Machine Learning Model will ensure Continuous Improvement.
